This is the first web server (API) I built with the Django framework. It uses a PostgreSQL database to store models. There is minimal front-end design (css and html) as this project was mainly focused on back-end functionality.

A quick note, not all the files used to run the web server are included on the GITHUB repository as some contained private information and others are just used for setup.

e.g. settings.py
