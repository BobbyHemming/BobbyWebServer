This is the first web server (API) I built with the Django framework. It accesses and PostgreSQL database to stores models and there is a minimal front-end design (css and html).

A quick note, not all the files used to run the web server are included on the GITHUB repository as some contained private information and others are just used for setup.

A key missing file is settings.py
